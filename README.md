# techUnicorn-BackEndAssessment
# Little Compiler

The project is done as a solution to the Back-End Assessment by Tech Unicorn. This is the first time I am creating a README.md file, so please excuse any mistakes :)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* Microsoft Visual Studio
* Or, any other C++ Compiler

### Installation

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ Download the Source.cpp and the inputFile.txt 
$ Add them to your C++ compiler or platform for running the code
$ If you want to try a different input, make changes accordingly to the inputFile.txt
$ Run the Source.cpp file, or click on Start Without Debugging to see the output in the console
```
